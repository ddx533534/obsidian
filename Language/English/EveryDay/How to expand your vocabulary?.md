##  1.[How to expand your vocabulary?](https://www.wikihow.com/Expand-Your-Vocabulary#Using-New-Words)

Part I -  **Learning New Words**
 1. Read voraciously
 2. Read high literature
 3. Read online sources
 4. Look up any words you don't recognize
	    When you see an unfamiliar word, do not skip over it impatiently. Try to puzzle out its possible meaning in the context of the sentence, then look it up in the dictionary and confirm its definition.

Part II -  **Using New Words**
1. Set a goal
   Looking up 20 new words a day in the dictionary will make it difficult to use any of them accurately. Be realistic and build practical vocabulary that you'll be able to use.
2. Use flashcards or post-it notes around your house
3. Write more
   Actively flexing your writing muscles will keep your vocabulary strong
4. Use accurate adjectives and precise nouns
   Don't use three words when one will do. A word is a useful addition to your vocabulary if it reduces the number of words in a sentence.
5. Don't flaunt it

Part III -  **Building Vocabulary**
1. Sign up to be emailed a "Word of the Day" using one of the many online dictionaries
2. Do word puzzles and play word games


Part  IV -  **Tips**
-   Frequent use of filler words such as "Like...", "So...", "Um...", "Ain't" and "Yea..." can make even people with large, more constructed vocabularies sound unlearned. Stay away from the unnecessary words and contractions.
    
-   Try to make a journal of synonyms/antonyms so that you can easily organize/learn the degree of "expression" of a particular word. For example, the word "destitute" sounds more intense than the word "poor".
    
-   You can purchase pre-attached, small, blank vocabulary cards which you can place into your bag or pocket and carry anywhere. Write the new words you're learning on them and pull out the flashcards while you're on the bus, in a queue, waiting to collect someone and brush up your learning.
    
-   Look on the back of products you have in your house (soda cans, food boxes, shampoo bottles etc.) They're bound to have complex words written on them.
    
-   There are many websites devoted to improving vocabulary. Find your favorites and make the most of them.
    
-   One of the most commonly used word websites, Dictionary.com, has a small section at the bottom of their homepage showing popular searches of the day.
    
-   Download a Free Dictionary App to your smartphone. Capture the image of the definition using the screenshot function so that you can easily review your words at a later point.
